                    <p class="description">Soccer is a fast–paced, strategy game played by men, women, and kids. Its professional leagues have gained millions of fans around the world. It is considered as a major sport that is well-known and widely played in almost all regions of the world, except for the United States and Canada.</p>

                            <p class="description">The game begins with the toss of a coin, and the winning captain decides which goal to defend or to take the first kick off. All players must use their feet head or chest to play the ball. Only the goalkeeper is allowed to use their hands, and only within their designated goal area. The aim of the game is to score a goal, which is achieved by kicking or heading the ball into the opposition team's goal. If the ball touches or crosses the side line, it is thrown back in by the team that was not the last to touch the ball. The game is controlled by a central referee, and two linesmen. They award free kicks and penalties when rules are broken. For continual breaking of rules or for a bad foul, the player may be sent off.</p>

                            <p class="description">A football match is played by two teams, with each allowed no more than 11 players on the field at any one time, one of whom is a goalkeeper.</p>

                    <h6>Brief Introduction</h6>
                    <p class="description">Basketball is a team sport in which ten players, five on a side, opposing one another on a rectangular court, have in play the primary objective to shoot a basketball (approximately 9.4 inches (24 cm) in diameter) through the defender's hoop (a basket 18 inches (46 cm) in diameter mounted 10 feet (3.048 m) high to a backboard at each end of the court) while preventing the opposing team from shooting through their own hoop. A field goal is worth two points, unless made from behind the three-point line, when it is worth three. After a foul, timed play stops and the player fouled or designated to shoot a technical foul is given one or more one-point free throws. The team with the most points at the end of the game wins, but if regulation play expires with the score tied, an additional period of play (overtime) is mandated.</p>

                                Game time is forfeit time. If a team has at least one player checked in they will receive an additional 5 minutes to assemble the rest of their team before forfeiting.
                                Games are divided into two halves of 20 minutes each. The time between halves will be left to the discretion of the game officials/supervisors, but not to exceed five minutes. No shot clock will be used.
                                (For Playoffs Only) If a team is leading by 30 points or more at or under the 5:00 mark of the 2nd half, or a team attains a lead of 50 points at any point of the game, the game will end.

                            <p class="description">A game consists of four quarters and a timekeeper officiates their duration. At the professional level, each quarter consists of 20 minutes of play, with the clock being stopped for instances such as scores, the ball going out of bounds or at the umpire's discretion, e.g. for serious injury. Lower grades of competition might employ shorter quarters of play. The umpire signals time-off to stop the clock for various reasons, such as the player in possession being tackled into stagnant play. Time resumes when the umpire signals time-on or when the ball is brought into play. Stoppages cause quarters to extend approximately 5–10 minutes beyond the 20 minutes of play. 6 minutes of rest is allowed before the second and fourth quarters, and 20 minutes of rest is allowed at half-time.</p>
                            <h6>Structure</h6>
                            <p class="description">Australian rules football, officially known as Australian football, or simply called Aussie rules, football or footy, is a contact sport played between two teams of eighteen players on an oval-shaped field, often a modified cricket ground. Points are scored by kicking the oval-shaped ball between the opposing goal posts (worth six points) or behind posts (worth one point). If the ball is kicked between the two goal posts (middle posts) then 6 points are awarded. If the ball goes between a goal post and one of the behind posts (point) then 1 point is awarded. 1 point is also awarded if the ball is carried or forced over the scoring line by the attacking team.</p>
                            <h6>Number Of Players</h6>
                            <p class="description">Each team will consist of 18 players of which are all assigned to different positions. These players are allowed to move freely on the pitch. Each team may also have up to three substitutes which are ‘rolling’ meaning they can come on and off as many times as they want. Once a starting player gets substituted these players then become rolling. The positions are broken down into Full Forward, Half Forward, Centre Line, Half Back and Full Back.</p>

                                The bowler must bowl 6 legal deliveries to constitute an over.</br>
                                A game must have two umpires stood at either end of the wicket. The umpires then must count the number of balls in the over, make decisions on whether the batsmen is out after an appeal and also check that the bowler has bowled a legal delivery.</br>
                                A batsmen can be given out by either being bowled ( the ball hitting their stumps), caught (fielder catches the ball without it bouncing), Leg Before Wicket (the ball hits the batsmen’s pads impeding its line into the stumps), stumped (the wicket keeper strikes the stumps with their gloves whilst the batsmen is outside of their crease with ball in hand), hit wicket (the batsmen hits their own wicket), Handled ball ( the batsmen handles the cricket ball on purpose), timed out (the player fails to reach the crease within 30 seconds of the previous batsmen leaving the field), hit ball twice (batsmen hits the cricket ball twice with their bat) and obstruction ( the batsmen purposely prevents the fielder from getting the ball).</br>
                                Test cricket is played over 5 days where each team has two innings (or two chances to bat).</br>

                            <h6>Time</h6>
                            <p class="description">A game is played for a duration of forty minute halves with a five minute halftime. One referee controls the match with the assistance of two touch judges. There are no time outs, except at the referee's discretion where he can allow one minute for an injured player to decide whether or not to continue to play. </p>
                            <h6>Structure</h6>
                            <p class="description">
                                The game begins with a kick off which is taken from the centre of the field. The team with the ball makes every effort to score a try once the ball is in play. A try is scored when a player touches the ball to the ground in the opponent's in-goal. The team is then awarded five points. After a try is scored, the team is given the opportunity to score a goal by kicking the ball over the opponents cross-bar and in between the goal posts, scoring an additional two points, also known as conversion points. The ball must be kicked from a line perpendicular to where the ball was touched down. If the opposing team commits a penalty at any time, the offended team can attempt a penalty kick for three points, either at the goal or a drop kick at the goal from anywhere in the field of play. 
                                During the game, players move forward towards their goal, however the ball can not be passed forward. The player must pass the ball backwards to his teammates while moving forward. Forward progress of the player carrying the ball may be impeded by tacking that player. Once a player is tackled, he must immediately pass or released the ball and move away from it.
