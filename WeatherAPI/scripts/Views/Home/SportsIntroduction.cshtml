                    <h6>Brief Introduction</h6>
                    <p class="description">Soccer is a fast–paced, strategy game played by men, women, and kids. Its professional leagues have gained millions of fans around the world. It is considered as a major sport that is well-known and widely played in almost all regions of the world, except for the United States and Canada.</p>

                            <h6>Structure</h6>
                            <p class="description">The game begins with the toss of a coin, and the winning captain decides which goal to defend or to take the first kick off. All players must use their feet head or chest to play the ball. Only the goalkeeper is allowed to use their hands, and only within their designated goal area. The aim of the game is to score a goal, which is achieved by kicking or heading the ball into the opposition team's goal. If the ball touches or crosses the side line, it is thrown back in by the team that was not the last to touch the ball. The game is controlled by a central referee, and two linesmen. They award free kicks and penalties when rules are broken. For continual breaking of rules or for a bad foul, the player may be sent off.</p>

                            <p class="description">A football match is played by two teams, with each allowed no more than 11 players on the field at any one time, one of whom is a goalkeeper.</p>

                    <h6>Brief Introduction</h6>
                    <p class="description">Basketball is a team sport in which ten players, five on a side, opposing one another on a rectangular court, have in play the primary objective to shoot a basketball (approximately 9.4 inches (24 cm) in diameter) through the defender's hoop (a basket 18 inches (46 cm) in diameter mounted 10 feet (3.048 m) high to a backboard at each end of the court) while preventing the opposing team from shooting through their own hoop. A field goal is worth two points, unless made from behind the three-point line, when it is worth three. After a foul, timed play stops and the player fouled or designated to shoot a technical foul is given one or more one-point free throws. The team with the most points at the end of the game wins, but if regulation play expires with the score tied, an additional period of play (overtime) is mandated.</p>

                            <p class="description">
                                Game time is forfeit time. If a team has at least one player checked in they will receive an additional 5 minutes to assemble the rest of their team before forfeiting.
                                Games are divided into two halves of 20 minutes each. The time between halves will be left to the discretion of the game officials/supervisors, but not to exceed five minutes. No shot clock will be used.
                                (For Playoffs Only) If a team is leading by 30 points or more at or under the 5:00 mark of the 2nd half, or a team attains a lead of 50 points at any point of the game, the game will end.

                            <p class="description">The object of basketball is to throw the ball (basketball) into a hoop to score points. The game is played out on a rectangular court and depending on which section of court you successfully throw a ball into the basket will depend on how many points are scored. The ball can be moved around the by dribbling or passing the ball. At the end of the game the team with the most points is declared the winner.</p>

                            <p class="description">Each team is made up of 12 players with only 5 allowed on the court at any time. The positions are broken up into Point Guard, Defensive Guard, Center, Offensive forward and Defensive Forward. Each player will then take up a position on the court but are allowed to move around as they please.</p>

                    <p class="description">The game is usually played by two teams of seven players, the aim being to outscore the opponents. Each player in a team has their position clearly marked by an abbreviation on their bib.

                            <p class="description">A game of netball lasts for an hour. The match is split into fifteen minute quarters with a three-minute break between the first and second and the third and fourth quarters. Half-time between the second and third quarters lasts five minutes.</p>

                            <p class="description">The team players, including substitutes must be named in advance of the match. The team that wins the coin toss before the start of the match can choose to either take the first centre pass, or to choose the end they would like to shoot at first. After the first centre pass, teams take it in turn to take subsequent centre passes. The ball returns to the centre after every goal scored. Teams swap ends after every quarter. In regular seven-a-side netball, one point is scored for every goal.</p>
                            <h6>Number Of Players</h6>
                            <p class="description">There are seven players allowed on court, per team, at any one time, but up to five substitutes are allowed (maximum of 12 players in total).</p>

                            <p class="description">No set time limit, A set is won when a player has won a minimum of six games with a two-game advantage over his opponent, for example, the potential score for a six-game set maybe 6 – 0 or 6 – 4 but not 6 - 5. In a scenario where the score is tied at 5 - 5, a player must win 2 consecutive games before he wins a set.  For example, a player may win a set with the score of 7 - 5 or 8 - 6. </p>
                            <h6>Structure</h6>
                            <p class="description">Usually the age-old question of who serves first is settled by a simple coin toss. The person who wins the coin toss may elect to serve first or select a side of the court which he would like to receive his opponents serve. The server will continue serving the ball to the receiver until the set has ended. After the set has ended, the receiver will become the server and serve the ball until the next set has ended. This process is repeated throughout the match. The point system of a tennis match is as follows: No points are scored = Love, 1 point scored = 15 points, 2 points scored = 30 points, 3 points scored = 40 points, 4 points earned = set point (set over). For a tennis player to win a game, he/she must win with at least a two-point lead.  If the score is tied at 40 to 40 (what is called as a “Deuce”), a player must earn two consecutive points (an “Advantage” point and “Point”) to win the game. If the player who has an “Advantage” point loses the next point, the score will be “Deuce” once again. </p>

                    <p class="description">Ice hockey is a powerful and fast moving sport, where the puck (which is the equivalent of the ball in field hockey) can be hit up to a speed of 100mph (160kph).</p>

                            <h6>Structure</h6>
                            <p class="description">
                                Hockey is played with 6 positions on the ice for each team. This is broken into 3 forwards, 2 defensemen, and 1 goalie. Forwards and defensemen will be substituted regularly througout the game. Substitutions occur in sets, or lines. A forward line consists of three players: the center, left wing and right wing. A defense line consists of two players: left defense and right defense. The goalie can be substituted, but usually plays the entire game. In normal hockey, substitutions are made "on-the-fly", meaning play is not stopped while the substitution occurs. Each forward line will play for about 1 to 2 minutes and defenseive lines will play for 3 to 5 minutes. The time a line spends on the ice before getting substituted is called a shift.
                                In SOM Hockey, the shifts will be 2 minutes each, where the buzzer will denote when a line change should occur. When the buzzer sounds in SOM Hockey, both forward and defensive lines will change. Lines will be organized by ability to ensure the skill level of both team's lines are comparable.
                            </p>
                            <h6>Number Of Players</h6>
                            <p class="description">Each team can have a maximum of 20 players. Of these 20 players only six may be on the ice at any one time. The rest will be used as substitutes but can come and go from the game as often as required. The six starters include a goal tender and 5 outfield players. Whilst each player will be given a position, the players are free to move around the ice as they choose. This does exclude the goal tender of which must remain within their half and not pass the center red line.</p>
